Add your Grafana dashboard screenshot as `grafana-screenshot.png` in this folder.

How to capture:
- Open Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
- Open dashboard "Local Observability Demo"
- Wait 30–60s for data; optionally trigger an alert (e.g., stop the `app` service)
- Take a screenshot and save it as `docs/grafana-screenshot.png`
